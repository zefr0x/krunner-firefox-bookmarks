> **Warning** : This repository/project is no longer maintained. I'm no longer using KDE's KRunner. If you are interested in the plugin, it's free software under the GPL-3.0 license, so you can create a fork and do any thing you want with it.

If you want an alternative, I created [`foxmarks`](https://github.com/zer0-x/foxmarks) and I use it with [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).

# TODO
- [ ] Display the favicons rather then firefox's icon. FireFox do save them in `favicons.sqlite` but i don't know how should I link them with the bookmarks or even how to read the image it self, yet.
- [ ] Add an action to open a sharing dialog to share the URL.

# Thanks to
